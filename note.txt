1. create a folder
2. create a .py file
3. inside this folder, create virtual environments, because we might need different pakagaes
    and different version of same pakagaes in different projects
    command line : python3 -m venv env
4. activate this environment 
    source env/bin/activate
5.list all installed dependencies
    pip3 list
6.write down all dependencies in a file
    pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
7. other people can install required dependencies of this project 
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
8. If we want to remove all at once then
    pip3 uninstall -r requirements.txt -y
